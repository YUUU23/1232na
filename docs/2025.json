    "Thoughts": "The main character is obsessed with 'keeping his family together'. He receives a potion that allows him to branch at any point in time and travel back in time; but only 50% of the time would he actually succeed. I liked the set-up and the mystery, but the imagery is violent, gruesome, and quite sexual. It can be uncomfortable, but the mystery does not disappoint! The twists and narration adds a lot."

    "Genre": ["Non-Fiction"],
    "Thoughts": "The author interweaves her own experience with 'chaos' and the things that don't go well in life, with a biography of David Starr Jordan. I had a lot of excitement for this book, since I like fish, and the premise of exploring chaos while collecting fish sounded interesting. However, the author sometimes tunes in to her private life a little too much for me, and a lot of time I don't agree with her moral values expressed in the book. The over-positive + bursting with excitement writing style also got too cringe for me.",

I was amazed to find so many gender roles, phrases, and experiences that are also stereotypically experienced by Chinese women, although the main character is Korean. The extremely calm, casual, and daily narration strikingly outlines out how realistic and 'normal' the main character's experience is.",

    "Thoughts": "I've never read Warriors before, but I see my friend re-reading it this past semester, so after a not very smooth semester I wanted to binge read a book that is more chill. I enjoyed the story, especially the pacing and characters were introduced well, such that I didn't lose track of the cat names. However, I did not expect so many cats would be violently attacked, but it's the wilderness I guess :< ",

    "Month": 12,
    "Language": "ENG",
    "Thoughts": "This is the fourth fantasy I've read with friends. I love this one for its lowkey and not overpowering romance developed between Keema and Jun, adventure-centered plot, and a writing style that I'm not familiar with, making the reading experience super unique. The main story is told in a theatre setting, and the POV switches from an audience in second person, a third person narrating the main story, to scattered throughout, first person snippets appending outsider perspectives for context of the setting. The switching was challenging for me to pick up, making some parts harder to understand and the beginning slower to read. However, the perspectives do blend together really well in a magical way near the end of the book. Another part I liked was how the antagonist characters were built and solidified through the overarching family history and dynamic plot line. Similarly, Shan's part of the story at the end really ties the beginning to end in a satisfying way.",
