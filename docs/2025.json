    "Thoughts": "The main character is obsessed with 'keeping his family together'. He receives a potion that allows him to branch at any point in time and travel back in time; but only 50% of the time would he actually succeed. I liked the set-up and the mystery, but the imagery is violent, gruesome, and quite sexual. It can be uncomfortable, but the mystery does not disappoint! The twists and narration adds a lot."

    "Genre": ["Non-Fiction"],
    "Thoughts": "The author interweaves her own experience with 'chaos' and the things that don't go well in life, with a biography of David Starr Jordan. I had a lot of excitement for this book, since I like fish, and the premise of exploring chaos while collecting fish sounded interesting. However, the author sometimes tunes in to her private life a little too much for me, and a lot of time I don't agree with her moral values expressed in the book. The over-positive + bursting with excitement writing style also got too cringe for me.",

    "Thoughts": "A depiction drawing out the life of 'any' east asian woman. I was amazed to find so many gender roles, phrases, and experiences that are also commonly experienced by Chinese women, although the main character is Korean. The extremely calm, casual, and daily narration strikingly outlines out how realistic and 'normal' the main character's experience is.",
